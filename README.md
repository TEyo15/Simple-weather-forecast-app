## 1. Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>

The Simple Weather Forecast App is a web application that allows users to retrieve and display current weather information for a specific location. It provides real-time data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description. This documentation will guide you on how to set up, use, and customize the app.

## 2. Prerequisites<a name="prerequisites"></a>

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- An internet connection
- A text editor or code editor for viewing and modifying the code (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)

## 3. Installation<a name="installation"></a>

This section explains how to set up and run the project locally.

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Open your terminal/command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
   - Run the following command to clone the repository:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-weather-app.git
     ```

2. **Open the Project:**
   - Navigate into the project directory:

     ```bash
     cd simple-weather-app
     ```

3. **Run the Application:**
   - Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to use the app.

## 4. Usage<a name="usage"></a>

Using the Simple Weather Forecast App is easy:

1. Open the app in your web browser by following the installation steps above.

2. You'll see the app's user interface, which includes a search bar to enter a location.

3. Enter the name of the city or location for which you want to get the weather forecast.

4. Click the "Search" button.

5. The app will make an API request to fetch the current weather data for the specified location, and it will display the weather information on the screen.

6. You'll see details such as the location name, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a weather description.

7. To get the weather for another location, simply enter a new location and click "Search" again.

## 5. API Integration<a name="api-integration"></a>

This app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data. To use this API in your own project or to customize this app, you need to obtain an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).

1. **Get an API Key:**
   - Visit the [OpenWeatherMap API website](https://openweathermap.org/) and sign up for an account.
   - After signing up, log in to your account and navigate to the API Keys section to generate an API key.

2. **Add Your API Key:**
   - In the `script.js` file, locate the `apiKey` variable.
   - Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual API key.

Now, your app should be able to make API requests with your key to fetch weather data.
